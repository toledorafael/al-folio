<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below.

<!-- My research interests are in software engineering with a particular focus on improving the quality of software.
Much of my work focuses on modelling software in terms of its features and on detecting, resolving, and managing feature interactions -- where the goal is to support the rapid development of new features / services / modular components that are oblivious of each other yet interoperate well. Applications of this work include feature-rich systems, systems-of-systems, and Internet of Things. My group develops theories of composition, analyses to detect feature interactions, architectures to coordinate features and resolve interactions, and proof systems for interoperability.

Dr. Storey’s research goal is to understand how technology can help people explore, understand, and share complex information and knowledge. She evaluates and applies techniques from knowledge engineering, social software, and visual interface design to applications such as collaborative software development, program comprehension, biomedical ontology development, and learning in Web-based environments.  -->

<!-- I study how humans interact with code and design new ways to build software. I work at the intersection of software engineering and human-computer interaction.

I use behavioral methods to study developers as users of their programming tools, understand what makes designing, implementing, and debugging software hard, and re-envision the relationship between developers and code. A key focus of my work has been designing new techniques to view and manipulate code. I have pioneered the design of crowdsourced programming environments, which reify developer’s design knowledge, strategies, and mental models in explicit forms which can be manipulated by program analysis tools and connected to code. -->

I work under the supervision of Prof. [Joanne Atlee](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jmatlee/index.shtml). I am a member of the [Waterloo Formal Methods Group (WatForm)](https://watform.uwaterloo.ca/), which is a joint Computer Science and Electrical Computer Engineering research group that investigates mathematical methods to aid in the design and verification of software systems. My research goal is to provide efficient interfaces for analyzing and comprehending the behaviour of large heterogeneous systems.

My work focuses on evaluating and applying visual analytics, graph visualization, and program comprehension techniques to facilitate program-analysis comprehension and software debugging. I use interactive software models to enable the engineers to query, explore, and identify unwanted behaviour of their programs.
