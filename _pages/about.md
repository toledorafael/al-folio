I am a PhD candidate at the [Cheriton School of Computer Science](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/) at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/). I work under the supervision of Prof. [Joanne Atlee](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jmatlee/index.shtml). I am a member of the [Waterloo Formal Methods Group (WatForm)](https://watform.uwaterloo.ca/), which is a joint Computer Science and Electrical Computer Engineering research group that investigates mathematical methods to aid in the design and verification of software systems.

My research investigates how graphical software models can help engineers develop and analyze software product lines. My current focus is developing interactive filtering and exploring models representing variability-aware analysis results. The interactive models enable engineers to identify and compare the behaviour of specific software products.
