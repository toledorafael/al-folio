I am a PhD candidate of the [Cheriton School of Computer Science](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/) at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/). I work under the supervision of Prof. [Joanne Atlee](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jmatlee/index.shtml). I am a member of the [Waterloo Formal Methods Group (WatForm)](https://watform.uwaterloo.ca/), which is a joint Computer Science and Electrical Computer Engineering research group that investigates mathematical methods to aid in the design and verification of software systems.

My research investigates the use of visual interfaces for the inspection and comprehension of analysis results of large heterogeneous systems. My current focus is on developing interactive lightweight models to represent the variability-aware analysis results of software product lines. The interactive models enable the engineers to visualize, explore, and compare the behaviour of specific software products.
