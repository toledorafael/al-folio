##### **Instructor**

###### [CS 246 - Object-Oriented Software Development](https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs246/) (Spring 2021, Spring 2022)
This course introduces students to basic UNIX software development tools and object-oriented programming in C++ to facilitate designing, coding, debugging, testing, and documenting medium-sized programs. Students learn to read a specification and design software to implement it. Important skills are selecting appropriate data structures and control structures, writing reusable code, reusing existing code, understanding basic performance issues, developing debugging skills, and learning to test a program.

##### **Instructional Apprentice**

###### [CS 246E - Object-Oriented Software Development (Enriched)](https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs246e/) (Fall 2021)
Introduction to object-oriented programming and to tools and techniques for software development. Designing, coding, debugging, testing, and documenting medium-sized programs: reading specifications and designing software to implement them; selecting appropriate data structures and control structures; writing reusable code; reusing existing code; basic performance issues; debuggers; test suites.

###### [CS 445/645/ECE 451 - Software Requirements Specification & Analysis](https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs445/) (Winter 2021, Winter 2022)
This course introduces students to the requirements definition phase of software development. It discusses processes, models, and notations, and processes for software requirements elicitation, identification, analysis, modeling, representation, specification, and validation. An important component is a group project: the software requirements specification of a large software system.

###### [SE 463 - Software Requirements: Specification & Analysis](https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~se463/) (Spring 2020)
Introduces students to the requirements definition phase of software development; models, notations, and processes for software requirements, identification, representation, analysis, and validation. Cost estimation from early documents and specifications.

###### [CS 442/642 - Principles of Programming Languages](https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs442/) (Winter 2019, Winter 2020)
This course examines foundational issues in contemporary programming languages, including abstraction mechanisms, operational semantics, type systems, and extensibility.
