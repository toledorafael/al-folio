##### **Instructor**

###### [CS 246 - Object-Oriented Software Development](https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs246/) (S21)
This course introduces students to basic UNIX software development tools and object-oriented programming in C++ to facilitate designing, coding, debugging, testing, and documenting medium-sized programs. Students learn to read a specification and design software to implement it. Important skills are selecting appropriate data structures and control structures, writing reusable code, reusing existing code, understanding basic performance issues, developing debugging skills, and learning to test a program.

###### [CS 445/645/ECE 451 - Software Requirements Specification & Analysis](https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs445/) (W21)
This course introduces students to the requirements definition phase of software development. It discusses processes, models, and notations, and processes for software requirements elicitation, identification, analysis, modeling, representation, specification, and validation. An important component is a group project: the software requirements specification of a large software system.

###### [SE 463 - Software Requirements: Specification & Analysis](https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~se463/) (S20)
Introduces students to the requirements definition phase of software development; models, notations, and processes for software requirements, identification, representation, analysis, and validation. Cost estimation from early documents and specifications.

###### [CS 442/642 - Principles of Programming Languages](https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs442/) (W19, W20)
This course examines foundational issues in contemporary programming languages, including abstraction mechanisms, operational semantics, type systems, and extensibility.

###### [CS 246E - Object-Oriented Software Development (Enriched)](https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs246e/) (F19, F20)
CS 246E is an enriched version of CS 246. Enriched courses are designed to offer appropriate challenges to better students. The learning objectives, required preparation, and general description are roughly the same as for the regular course, and the corresponding regular course description page provides more detail. Depending on their approach, instructors may teach more rapidly, add new topics, rearrange topics or change their emphasis, or offer alternative approaches that meet curricular goals. Students should contact individual instructors for further details
